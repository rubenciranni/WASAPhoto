    The WASAPhoto Backend API allows to perform the following operations:
    - Log in by specifying a username.
    - Get the a stream of photos (images) in reverse chronological order for the logged in user,
      with information about when each photo was uploaded (date and time) and how many likes
      and comments it has. The stream is composed by photos from “following”
      (other users that the user follows).
    - Place (or  remove) a “like” to photos from other users.
    - Add comments to any image (even those uploaded by themself), and remove
      them (only authors can remove their comments).
    - Ban other users and remove the ban.
    - Get users profiles showsing: the user’s photos (in reverse chronological order),
      how many photos have been uploaded, and the user’s followers and following.
    - Change username.
    - Upload photos and remove photos (removal of an image will also remove likes and comments).
    - Follow/unfollow other users.
    - Search other user profiles via username.
